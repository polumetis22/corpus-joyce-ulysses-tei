<div type="section" n="1"><p><lb n="100001"/>The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth
<lb n="100002"/>watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to
<lb n="100003"/>three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again?
<lb n="100004"/>Dignam. Yes. <foreign xml:lang="la">Vere dignum et iustum est.</foreign> Brother Swan was the person to
<lb n="100005"/>see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical
<lb n="100006"/>catholic: useful at mission time.</p>
<p><lb n="100007"/>A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
<lb n="100008"/>crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the
<lb n="100009"/>sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
<lb n="100010"/>reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
<lb n="100011"/>purse held, he knew, one silver crown.</p>
<p><lb n="100012"/>Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for
<lb n="100013"/>long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
<lb n="100014"/>ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: <said who="Thomas Wolsey" direct="false" rend="italics">If
<lb n="100015"/>I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
<lb n="100016"/>abandoned me in my old days</said>. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking
<lb n="100017"/>leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P.
<lb n="100018"/><said who="Elizabeth Sheehy">―Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?</said></p>
<p><lb n="100019"/>Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton
<lb n="100020"/>probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at
<lb n="100021"/>Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.
<lb n="100022"/>And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be
<lb n="100023"/>sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very
<lb n="100024"/>probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O,
<lb n="100025"/>yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.</p>
<p><lb n="100026"/>Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy
<lb n="100027"/>M. P. looking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy
<lb n="100028"/>M. P. Yes, he would certainly call.
<lb n="100029"/><said who="John Conmee">―Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.</said></p>
<p><lb n="100030"/>Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
<lb n="100031"/>jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in
<lb n="100032"/>going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.</p>
<p><lb n="100033"/>Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
<lb n="100034"/>Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.
<lb n="100035"/><said who="Bernard Vaughan">―Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?</said></p>
<p><lb n="100036"/>A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in
<lb n="100037"/>his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.
<lb n="100038"/>Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?</p>
<p><lb n="100039"/>O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.</p>
<p><lb n="100040"/>Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of
<lb n="100041"/>Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha.
<lb n="100042"/>And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what
<lb n="100043"/>was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other
<lb n="100044"/>little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to
<lb n="100045"/>have.</p>
<p><lb n="100046"/>Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam
<lb n="100047"/>and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.
<lb n="100048"/><said who="John Conmee">―But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man,</said> he said.</p>
<p><lb n="100049"/>The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
<lb n="100050"/><said who="Belvedere schoolboys">―O, sir.</said>
<lb n="100051"/><said who="John Conmee">―Well, let me see if you can post a letter,</said> Father Conmee said.</p>
<p><lb n="100052"/>Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's
<lb n="100053"/>letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father
<lb n="100054"/>Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
<lb n="100055"/>east.</p>
<p><lb n="100056"/>Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c, in silk hat, slate
<lb n="100057"/>frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers,
<lb n="100058"/>canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment
<lb n="100059"/>most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the
<lb n="100060"/>corner of Dignam's court.</p>
<p><lb n="100061"/>Was that not Mrs M'Guinness?</p>
<p><lb n="100062"/>Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from
<lb n="100063"/>the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and
<lb n="100064"/>saluted. How did she do?</p>
<p><lb n="100065"/>A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to
<lb n="100066"/>think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a ... what should he
<lb n="100067"/>say? .... such a queenly mien.</p>
<p><lb n="100068"/>Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the
<lb n="100069"/>shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B. A. will (D. V.)
<lb n="100070"/>speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a
<lb n="100071"/>few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted
<lb n="100072"/>according to their lights.</p>
<p><lb n="100073"/>Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North
<lb n="100074"/>Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an
<lb n="100075"/>important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.</p>
<p><lb n="100076"/>A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All
<lb n="100077"/>raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.
<lb n="100078"/>Christian brother boys.</p>
<p><lb n="100079"/>Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint
<lb n="100080"/>Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father
<lb n="100081"/>Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally
<lb n="100082"/>they were also badtempered.</p>
<p><lb n="100083"/>Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
<lb n="100084"/>nobleman. And now it was an office or something.</p>
<p><lb n="100085"/>Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was
<lb n="100086"/>saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.
<lb n="100087"/>Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours
<lb n="100088"/>that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed
<lb n="100089"/>Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a
<lb n="100090"/>dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were
<lb n="100091"/>continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.
<lb n="100092"/>Still, an act of perfect contrition.</p>
<p><lb n="100093"/>Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the
<lb n="100094"/>window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and
<lb n="100095"/>were saluted.</p>
<p><lb n="100096"/>Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where
<lb n="100097"/>Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of
<lb n="100098"/>hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee
<lb n="100099"/>saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee
<lb n="100100"/>observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.
<lb n="100101"/>Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge,
<lb n="100102"/>a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated
<lb n="100103"/>amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was
<lb n="100104"/>idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who
<lb n="100105"/>had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to
<lb n="100106"/>town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.</p>
<p><lb n="100107"/>On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint
<lb n="100108"/>Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward
<lb n="100109"/>bound tram.</p>
<p><lb n="100110"/>Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley
<lb n="100111"/>C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen
<lb n="100112"/>bridge.</p>
<p><lb n="100113"/>At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound
<lb n="100114"/>tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.</p>
<p><lb n="100115"/>Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked
<lb n="100116"/>with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence
<lb n="100117"/>and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.
<lb n="100118"/>Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his
<lb n="100119"/>visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the
<lb n="100120"/>occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so
<lb n="100121"/>short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.</p>
<p><lb n="100122"/>It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
<lb n="100123"/>Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father
<lb n="100124"/>Conmee supposed.</p>
<p><lb n="100125"/>A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the
<lb n="100126"/>glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping
<lb n="100127"/>her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.</p>
<p><lb n="100128"/>Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also
<lb n="100129"/>that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
<lb n="100130"/>seat.</p>
<p><lb n="100131"/>Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
<lb n="100132"/>mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.</p>
<p><lb n="100133"/>At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an
<lb n="100134"/>old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled
<lb n="100135"/>the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a
<lb n="100136"/>marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
<lb n="100137"/>basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
<lb n="100138"/>the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always
<lb n="100139"/>to be told twice <said who="John Conmee" direct="false" rend="italics">bless you, my child,</said> that they have been absolved, <said who="John Conmee" direct="false" rend="italics">pray for
<lb n="100140"/>me</said>. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.</p>
<p><lb n="100141"/>From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick
<lb n="100142"/>niggerlips at Father Conmee.</p>
<p><lb n="100143"/>Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow
<lb n="100144"/>men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission
<lb n="100145"/>and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown
<lb n="100146"/>and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last
<lb n="100147"/>hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, <foreign xml:lang="fr">Le
<lb n="100148"/>Nombre des Élus</foreign>, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were
<lb n="100149"/>millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the
<lb n="100150"/>faith had not (D. V.) been brought. But they were God's souls, created by
<lb n="100151"/>God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste,
<lb n="100152"/>if one might say.</p>
<p><lb n="100153"/>At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
<lb n="100154"/>conductor and saluted in his turn.</p>
<p><lb n="100155"/>The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and
<lb n="100156"/>name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,
<lb n="100157"/>immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.
<lb n="100158"/>Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.
<lb n="100159"/>Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in
<lb n="100160"/>the barony.</p>
<p><lb n="100161"/>Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book <title type="book">Old Times in the
<lb n="100162"/>Barony</title> and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of
<lb n="100163"/>Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.</p>
<p><lb n="100164"/>A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough
<lb n="100165"/>Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
<lb n="100166"/>not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the
<lb n="100167"/>jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
<lb n="100168"/>adultery fully, <foreign xml:lang="la">eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris</foreign>, with her
<lb n="100169"/>husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as
<lb n="100170"/>women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.</p>
<p><lb n="100171"/>Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed
<lb n="100172"/>however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not
<lb n="100173"/>our ways.</p>
<p><lb n="100174"/>Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was
<lb n="100175"/>humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he
<lb n="100176"/>smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full
<lb n="100177"/>fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
<lb n="100178"/>were impalmed by Don John Conmee.</p>
<p><lb n="100179"/>It was a charming day.</p>
<p><lb n="100180"/>The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
<lb n="100181"/>curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of
<lb n="100182"/>small white clouds going slowly down the wind. <foreign xml:lang="fr">Moutonner</foreign>, the French
<lb n="100183"/>said. A just and homely word.</p>
<p><lb n="100184"/>Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning
<lb n="100185"/>clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble
<lb n="100186"/>of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the
<lb n="100187"/>cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He
<lb n="100188"/>was their rector: his reign was mild.</p>
<p><lb n="100189"/>Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary
<lb n="100190"/>out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.</p>
<p><lb n="100191"/>Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had
<lb n="100192"/>come.</p>
<p><lb n="100193"/>Father Conmee read in secret <foreign xml:lang="la">Pater</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">Ave</foreign> and crossed his breast.
<lb n="100194"/><foreign xml:lang="la">Deus in adiutorium.</foreign></p>
<p><lb n="100195"/>He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till
<lb n="100196"/>he came to <foreign xml:lang="la">Res</foreign> in <foreign xml:lang="la">Beati immaculati</foreign>:
<lb n="100197"/><said who="John Conmee">―<foreign xml:lang="la">Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiae
<lb n="100198"/>tuae.</foreign></said></p>
<p><lb n="100199"/>A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came
<lb n="100200"/>a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man
<lb n="100201"/>raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
<lb n="100202"/>detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.</p>
<p><lb n="100203"/>Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
<lb n="100204"/>breviary. <foreign xml:lang="he">Sin</foreign>:
<lb n="100205"/><said who="John Conmee">―<foreign xml:lang="la">Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.</foreign></said></p>

<div type="section" n="2"><p><lb n="100207"/>Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his
<lb n="100208"/>drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,
<lb n="100209"/>went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
<lb n="100210"/>furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to
<lb n="100211"/>the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and
<lb n="100212"/>leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.</p>

<lb n="100229"/>skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.
<lb n="100230"/>Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled

<lb n="100528"/>with long tails. Astronomy it was about.</said></p>

<lb n="100546"/>catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were
<lb n="100547"/>there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curaçoa to
<lb n="100548"/>which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came

<lb n="100553"/>jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after
<lb n="100554"/>the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's night on the
<lb n="100555"/>Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the
<lb n="100556"/>car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets:
<lb n="100557"/><title type="song">Lo, the early beam of morning</title>. She was well primed with a good load of
<lb n="100558"/>Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had
<lb n="100559"/>her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless
<lb n="100560"/>her. Like that.</said></p>
<p><lb n="100561"/>He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:

<lb n="100563"/>what I mean?</said></p>
<p><lb n="100564"/>His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in
<lb n="100565"/>delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.
<lb n="100566"/><said who="Lenehan">―The lad stood to attention anyhow,</said> he said with a sigh. <said who="Lenehan">She's a gamey
<lb n="100567"/>mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets
<lb n="100568"/>in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and
<lb n="100569"/>Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was
<lb n="100570"/>lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she
<lb n="100571"/>spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. <said who="Molly Bloom" rend="italics">And what star is that, Poldy?</said> says
<lb n="100572"/>she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. <said who="Chris Callinan" rend="italics">That one, is it?</said> says Chris Callinan,
<lb n="100573"/><said who="Chris Callinan" rend="italics">sure that's only what you might call a pinprick</said>. By God, he wasn't far wide
<lb n="100574"/>of the mark.</said></p>
<p><lb n="100575"/>Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft
<lb n="100576"/>laughter.
<lb n="100577"/><said who="Lenehan">―I'm weak,</said> he gasped.</p>
<p><lb n="100578"/>M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.
<lb n="100579"/>Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his
<lb n="100580"/>hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.
<lb n="100581"/><said who="Lenehan">―He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is,</said> he said seriously. <said who="Lenehan">He's not one of

<p><lb n="100596"/>Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined

<p><lb n="100599"/>On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment

<lb n="100721"/>you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your
<lb n="100722"/>other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive.
<lb n="100723"/>Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those
<lb n="100724"/>farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin,
<lb n="100725"/>Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that <name type="ship">General Slocum</name>
<lb n="100726"/>explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending
<lb n="100727"/>scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What
<lb n="100728"/>do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous
<lb n="100729"/>revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What
<lb n="100730"/>I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that ....
<lb n="100731"/>Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is
<lb n="100732"/>that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say
<lb n="100733"/>is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.</p>
<p><lb n="100734"/>I smiled at him. <said who="Tom Kernan" direct="false" rend="italics">America</said>, I said quietly, just like that. <said who="Tom Kernan" direct="false" rend="italics">What is it? The

<lb n="100737"/>always someone to pick it up.</p>
<p><lb n="100738"/>Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a

<p><lb n="100742"/>Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of
<lb n="100743"/>Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson
<lb n="100744"/>street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under
<lb n="100745"/>three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff
<lb n="100746"/>had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave
<lb n="100747"/>me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.</p>
<p><lb n="100748"/>Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.
<lb n="100749"/>Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your
<lb n="100750"/>custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
<lb n="100751"/>has it.</p>

<p><lb n="100755"/>Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.
<lb n="100756"/>Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy
<lb n="100757"/>body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned
<lb n="100758"/>Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it.
<lb n="100759"/>No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that.
<lb n="100760"/>Damn like him.</p>
<p><lb n="100761"/>Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.
<lb n="100762"/>Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his
<lb n="100763"/>fat strut.</p>
<p><lb n="100764"/>Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black

<lb n="100766"/>drove by in her noddy.</p>
<p><lb n="100767"/>Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers
<lb n="100768"/>too. Fourbottle men.</p>
<p><lb n="100769"/>Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a
<lb n="100770"/>midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in

<lb n="100774"/>the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin
<lb n="100775"/>Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the
<lb n="100776"/>reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary
<lb n="100777"/>bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.</p>
<p><lb n="100778"/>Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John
<lb n="100779"/>Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the
<lb n="100780"/>office of Messrs Collis and Ward.</p>
<p><lb n="100781"/>Mr Kernan approached Island street. Times of the troubles. Must ask
<lb n="100782"/>Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington.
<lb n="100783"/>When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.
<lb n="100784"/>Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand
<lb n="100785"/>nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald
<lb n="100786"/>escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.</p>
<p><lb n="100787"/>Damn good gin that was.</p>
<p><lb n="100788"/>Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian,
<lb n="100789"/>that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on
<lb n="100790"/>the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram.
<lb n="100791"/>They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.

<p><lb n="100794"/>A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders

<p><lb n="100796"/>Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.</p>

<lb n="100801"/>fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the

<lb n="100803"/>slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies,
<lb n="100804"/>leprous and winedark stones.</p>
<p><lb n="100805"/>Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights
<lb n="100806"/>shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their

<p><lb n="100808"/>She dances in a foul gloom where gum burns with garlic. A
<lb n="100809"/>sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and

<lb n="100811"/>hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.</p>
<p><lb n="100812"/>Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem,
<lb n="100813"/>turned it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape
<lb n="100814"/>gloating on a stolen hoard.</p>
<p><lb n="100815"/>And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick
<lb n="100816"/>words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat

<p><lb n="100818"/>Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through
<lb n="100819"/>Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one
<lb n="100820"/>with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.</p>
<p><lb n="100821"/>The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
<lb n="100822"/>powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always
<lb n="100823"/>without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between
<lb n="100824"/>them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter
<lb n="100825"/>them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who
<lb n="100826"/>can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look

<p><lb n="100828"/>Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You

<p><lb n="100830"/>Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking
<lb n="100831"/>against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of
<lb n="100832"/>Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood
<lb n="100833"/>round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed
<lb n="100834"/>gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes'

<lb n="101044"/>his Panama to Haines:
<lb n="101045"/><said who="Buck Mulligan">―Parnell's brother. There in the corner.</said></p>
<p><lb n="101046"/>They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man
<lb n="101047"/>whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.
<lb n="101048"/><said who="Haines">―Is that he?</said> Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.
<lb n="101049"/><said who="Buck Mulligan">―Yes,</said> Mulligan said. <said who="Buck Mulligan">That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.</said></p>
<p><lb n="101050"/>John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey
<lb n="101051"/>claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under
<lb n="101052"/>its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more
<lb n="101053"/>upon a working corner.
<lb n="101054"/><said who="Haines">―I'll take a <foreign xml:lang="fr">mélange</foreign>,</said> Haines said to the waitress.

<p><lb n="101057"/>When she had gone he said, laughing:

<p><lb n="101060"/>Haines opened his newbought book.

<lb n="101062"/>that have lost their balance.</said></p>
<p><lb n="101063"/>The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
<lb n="101064"/><said who="onelegged sailor">―<quote type="song">England expects</quote> .....</said></p>
<p><lb n="101065"/>Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.

<lb n="101069"/>with thumb and forefinger. <said who="Haines">Now I am speculating what it would be likely to
<lb n="101070"/>be. Such persons always have.</said></p>
<p><lb n="101071"/>Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.
<lb n="101072"/><said who="Buck Mulligan">―They drove his wits astray,</said> he said, <said who="Buck Mulligan">by visions of hell. He will never
<lb n="101073"/>capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death
<lb n="101074"/>and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of
<lb n="101075"/>creation ....</said>
<lb n="101076"/><said who="Haines">―Eternal punishment,</said> Haines said, nodding curtly. <said who="Haines">I see. I tackled him this
<lb n="101077"/>morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's rather
<lb n="101078"/>interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point
<lb n="101079"/>out of that.</said></p>
<p><lb n="101080"/>Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her
<lb n="101081"/>to unload her tray.
<lb n="101082"/><said who="Haines">―He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth,</said> Haines said, amid the
<lb n="101083"/>cheerful cups. <said who="Haines">The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of

<p><lb n="101086"/>He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped
<lb n="101087"/>cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over
<lb n="101088"/>its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
<lb n="101089"/><said who="Buck Mulligan">―Ten years,</said> he said, chewing and laughing. <said who="Buck Mulligan">He is going to write something
<lb n="101090"/>in ten years.</said>

<p><lb n="101093"/>He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.

<div type="section" n="18"><p><lb n="101122"/>Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam,
<lb n="101123"/>pawing the pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he
<lb n="101124"/>had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too
<lb n="101125"/>blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and
<lb n="101126"/>Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and
<lb n="101127"/>sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from
<lb n="101128"/>Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the
<lb n="101129"/>whole blooming time and sighing.</p>
<p><lb n="101130"/>After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress
<lb n="101131"/>milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to
<lb n="101132"/>their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning
<lb n="101133"/>Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet
<lb n="101134"/>sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty
<lb n="101135"/>sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,
<lb n="101136"/>that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance,
<lb n="101137"/>soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left
<lb n="101138"/>turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is it? May the
<lb n="101139"/>twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right
<lb n="101140"/>and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.
<lb n="101141"/>Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall,
<lb n="101142"/>charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in
<lb n="101143"/>the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him
<lb n="101144"/>for one time he found out.</p>
<p><lb n="101145"/>Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker
<lb n="101146"/>going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow
<lb n="101147"/>would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker
<lb n="101148"/>for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of
<lb n="101149"/>him, dodging and all.</p>
<p><lb n="101150"/>In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth
<lb n="101151"/>and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
<lb n="101152"/>telling him and grinning all the time.</p>
<p><lb n="101153"/>No Sandymount tram.</p>
<p><lb n="101154"/>Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to
<lb n="101155"/>his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The
<lb n="101156"/>blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end
<lb n="101157"/>to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay
<lb n="101158"/>away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in
<lb n="101159"/>mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then
<lb n="101160"/>they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.</p>
<p><lb n="101161"/>His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
<lb n="101162"/>fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were
<lb n="101163"/>screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing
<lb n="101164"/>it downstairs.</p>
<p><lb n="101165"/>Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
<lb n="101166"/>the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and
<lb n="101167"/>heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing
<lb n="101168"/>on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for to
<lb n="101169"/>boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again.
<lb n="101170"/>Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to
<lb n="101171"/>ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his
<lb n="101172"/>teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I
<lb n="101173"/>hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father
<lb n="101174"/>Conroy on Saturday night.</p>

<div type="section" n="19"><p><lb n="101176"/>William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by
<lb n="101177"/>lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal
<lb n="101178"/>lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de
<lb n="101179"/>Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. in attendance.</p>
<p><lb n="101180"/>The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted
<lb n="101181"/>by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the
<lb n="101182"/>northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through
<lb n="101183"/>the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river
<lb n="101184"/>greeted him vainly from afar. Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord
<lb n="101185"/>Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley
<lb n="101186"/>White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's,
<lb n="101187"/>the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with
<lb n="101188"/>his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more
<lb n="101189"/>quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through
<lb n="101190"/>Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four
<lb n="101191"/>Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw
<lb n="101192"/>him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of
<lb n="101193"/>Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an
<lb n="101194"/>elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by
<lb n="101195"/>King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty.
<lb n="101196"/>From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river
<lb n="101197"/>hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the
<lb n="101198"/>Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head
<lb n="101199"/>watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his
<lb n="101200"/>way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet
<lb n="101201"/>and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus'
<lb n="101202"/>greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M. A., made
<lb n="101203"/>obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant
<lb n="101204"/>had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy,
<lb n="101205"/>taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger
<lb n="101206"/>Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,
<lb n="101207"/>carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up,
<lb n="101208"/>knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see
<lb n="101209"/>what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow
<lb n="101210"/>furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord
<lb n="101211"/>lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's
<lb n="101212"/>winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord
<lb n="101213"/>lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable
<lb n="101214"/>William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's
<lb n="101215"/>alltimesticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited
<lb n="101216"/>freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, <foreign xml:lang="fr">dernier cri</foreign> James. Over against
<lb n="101217"/>Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the
<lb n="101218"/>cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him,
<lb n="101219"/>took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and
<lb n="101220"/>doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with
<lb n="101221"/>dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William
<lb n="101222"/>Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and
<lb n="101223"/>also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the
<lb n="101224"/>D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the
<lb n="101225"/>viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms
<lb n="101226"/>darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In
<lb n="101227"/>Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from
<lb n="101228"/>Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes
<lb n="101229"/>spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of
<lb n="101230"/>Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold
<lb n="101231"/>hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the
<lb n="101232"/>foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her
<lb n="101233"/>hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted
<lb n="101234"/>in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast
<lb n="101235"/>and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C.,
<lb n="101236"/>agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded
<lb n="101237"/>white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him,
<lb n="101238"/>E. L. Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's
<lb n="101239"/>music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c, gaily
<lb n="101240"/>apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the
<lb n="101241"/>provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks
<lb n="101242"/>with skyblue clocks to the refrain of <title type="song">My girl's a Yorkshire girl</title>. Blazes
<lb n="101243"/>Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue
<lb n="101244"/>tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge.
<lb n="101245"/>His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three
<lb n="101246"/>ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As
<lb n="101247"/>they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his
<lb n="101248"/>bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in
<lb n="101249"/>College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped
<lb n="101250"/>after the cortège:
<lb n="101251"/><quote rend="inset">But though she's a factory lass
<lb n="101252"/>And wears no fancy clothes.

<lb n="101255"/>Yorkshire relish for
<lb n="101256"/>My little Yorkshire rose.
<lb n="101257"/>Baraabum.</quote>
<lb n="101258"/>Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.
<lb n="101259"/>Thrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C.
<lb n="101260"/>Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's hotel
<lb n="101261"/>Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce
<lb n="101262"/>eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the
<lb n="101263"/>window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by
<lb n="101264"/>Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap.
<lb n="101265"/>As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius
<lb n="101266"/>Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and
<lb n="101267"/>raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His
<lb n="101268"/>collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus
<lb n="101269"/>bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following
<lb n="101270"/>towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling opposite
<lb n="101271"/>Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh,
<lb n="101272"/>eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At
<lb n="101273"/>the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub
<lb n="101274"/>lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington
<lb n="101275"/>road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in
<lb n="101276"/>which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady
<lb n="101277"/>mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne
<lb n="101278"/>roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male
<lb n="101279"/>walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house
<lb n="101280"/>said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital
<lb n="101281"/>with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano
<lb n="101282"/>Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door.</p></div>
